# The Golden Path

Welcome to the Software Engineering Workshop! In this course, you'll have the chance to design and create web and mobile applications. To make this process as smooth as possible, we encourage you to follow the "Golden Path," which is a set of recommendations on languages, tools, and technologies to use. These have been carefully chosen because they are easy to learn, are taught in other classes, and our TAs are familiar with them.

## Database

- **Firebase**: Provides a lot of features right out of the box, such as authentication and a document-based database. With Firebase security rules, you can secure your database without writing any backend code.
- **Prisma**: If you are looking for a relational database with a stellar ORM, Prisma comes highly recommended.

## Web Development

- **Deployment**: For deployment, we recommend using **Vercel**. It makes serverless deployment super simple.
  
- **Frameworks**:
  - **Next.js**: For React-based projects.
  - **Nuxt.js**: For Vue-based projects.

  _Note: We advise you to stay away from server-side rendering (SSR)._

- **UI Libraries**: 
  - **React Options**: Chakra, Ant, MUI, Bootstrap, Bulma
  - **Vue Options**: Vuetify, Quasar

- **Additional Services**:
  - **Firebase for Auth**: Itâ€™s easy to set up and integrates well with many frontend frameworks.
  - **Document Database**: Feel free to use Firebase for this.

- **Serverless**: If you can make your application serverless, do so. Vercel will make this straightforward. If you need a more customized backend, you can also use AWS for backend APIs.

---

## Mobile App Development

- **Platform**: We strongly recommend using **React Native and Expo** for mobile app development. This offers a development experience similar to web development and allows for rapid testing on devices.

  _Note: Make sure a majority of your team is familiar with the development environment for the platform you choose._

- **iOS Specifics**: Only go for this route if everyone on your team has a Mac.

By adhering to this Golden Path, you are setting yourself up for a smoother development process, allowing you to focus more on building great applications and less on solving compatibility issues or learning curves. We're excited to see what you'll build!
